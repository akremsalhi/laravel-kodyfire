> Generate Laravel models, migrations and more using [Kodyfire](https://github.com/nooqta/kodyfire).

### [Homepage](https://github.com/nooqta/kodyfire)

## Requirements

laravel-kodyfire requires the [kodyfire-cli](https://github.com/nooqta/kodyfire) to be installed

```sh
npm install -g kodyfire-cli
```
## Install

```sh
npm i laravel-kodyfire
```

## Usage

### Method 1: As a generator
In order to generate your artifacts, run the `generate` command. The syntax is `kody generate|g [kody] [concept]`. If you ommit `kody` and `concept` the assistant will prompt you to select them. As an example, run the following command from your terminal:
```sh
kody generate laravel model
```

or you can you the shorthand generation command
```sh
kody g laravel:model YourModelName
```
The shorthand will execute without prompting if no additional arguments are required

You can also create related artifacts by providing the `--includes` option with a list of comma seperated artifacts
```sh
kody g laravel:model YourModelName --includes migration,seeder,factory
```
In order to list available concepts, run the following command:
```sh
kody ls laravel
```
To list available templates run: 
```sh
kody ls laravel -s templates
```
To use a different template run
```sh
kody g laravel:model YourModelName --overwrites template:templateName
```
When providing a template name ommit the prefix and extension part of the template name. For example if the template name is `controller.api.php.template`, You should overwrite the template as follow:
```sh
kody g laravel:controller YourControllerlName --overwrites template:api
```

`--overwrites` are the concept arguments. In order to list available arguments of all concepts run the following command: 
```sh
kody ls laravel -s overwrites
```
### Method 2: As an importer
You can use a source containing the definition of the artifacts you want to create at once. Available sources: yaml, plantuml(class diagram).  As an example, A declaration for the yaml laravel source import file might look like the following
```yaml
models:
  user:
    fields:
      name: string
      email: string nullable unique
      status: enum:active,inactive default:active
      password,phone,role: string nullable
      email_verified_at: timestamp nullable
    hidden: password
    relations:
      belongsTo: Company
	  ...
```

After adding your definitions, run the following command to import your assets.

```sh
kody import laravel migration,model -s import.yaml
```
### Using your own templates
Since every project has its specificity, you can always overwrite the default templates provided by the package.
In order to start using your own templates, you must publish the default templates into your root project under `.kody/laravel-kodyfire`.
To do so run
```sh
kody publish laravel
```
or
```sh
kody publish laravel templateName
```
if you want to overwrite a single template

After updating the published template content. Test drive your template by running
```sh
kody g model yourModelName
```

To list the concepts of your installed kody (laravel), run `kody list laravel` 
- `name` _string_ - The name that will be used to generate your artifact.
