> Generate Laravel models, migrations and more using [Kodyfire](https://github.com/nooqta/kodyfire).

### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/nooqta/kodyfire)

## Requirements

laravel-kodyfire requires the [kodyfire-cli](https://github.com/nooqta/kodyfire) to be installed

```sh
npm install -g kodyfire-cli
```
## Install

```sh
npm i laravel-kodyfire
```

## Usage

### Method 1: As a generator
In order to generate your artifacts, run the `generate` command. The syntax is `kody generate|g [kody] [concept]`. If you ommit `kody` and `concept` the assistant will prompt you to select them. As an example, run the following command from your terminal:
```sh
kody generate laravel model
```

### Method 2: As an importer
You can use a source containing the definition of the artifacts you want to create at once. Available sources: yaml, plantuml(class diagram).  As an example, A declaration for the yaml laravel source import file might look like the following
```yaml
models:
  user:
    fields:
      name: string
      email: string nullable unique
      status: enum:active,inactive default:active
      password,phone,role: string nullable
      email_verified_at: timestamp nullable
    hidden: password
    relations:
      belongsTo: Company
	  ...
```

After adding your definitions, run the following command to import your assets.

```sh
kody import laravel migration,model -s import.yaml
```

### Available concepts 

#### `concept` (default)
> Generates a generic concept

##### Usage
```bash
kody g laravel yourConcept
```
